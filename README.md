## Project Description
### This project promotes the progress of science in quantum computing algorithms and cryptologic techniques in order to improve security of encrypted information, which will have national security and defense applications. Currently, the commonly used encryption algorithms such as RSA are considered “unbreakable” by modern digital computers due to the complexity of computation that would be required. However, this may change in the next decade or so in light of advances in quantum science. Quantum mechanics has led to the discovery that considerable numbers of states can be manipulated at the same time thus significantly reduce the amount of time in processing. New quantum computers have shown the baseline of “quantum supremacy” in solving problems that classical digital computers practically cannot. Efficient quantum algorithms are key to enable computer scientists to take full advantage of the next generation of practical quantum computers to efficiently solve today’s unsolvable problems. Advances in quantum science in both breaking and securing the encryptions are paramount for national security and preventing adversaries from taking advantage of critical areas of national defense. This project seeks to discover efficient quantum cryptologic methods (i.e. the art of revealing the secret) and secure quantum cryptographic techniques (i.e. the science of making the secret more secure). This project not only exhibits the excellence in scientific research, but also supports diversity and inclusion goals for the benefit of society.
